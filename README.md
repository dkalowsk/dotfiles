# dotfiles
A collection of dot files that I use for daily consumption.  Use
of these files is at your own risk, as I make no promise that they
work or are in working order at any time.

# Usage
Everything is setup to work with the `stow` application

Alternately, you can try using the `bootstrap.sh` script to automate
the entire process.

# Installation

The easiest way to install everything is to run the `bootstrap` application,
which by default will give you the options.  If you're ready to just take a
risk and try it, `bootstrap -a` is your friend.

Good luck!
