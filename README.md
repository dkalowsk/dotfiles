# dotfiles
A collection of dot files that I use for daily consumption.  Use
of these files is at your own risk, as I make no promise that they
work or are in working order at any time.

# Usage
Everything is setup to work with the `stow` application

Alternately, you can try using the `bootstrap.sh` script to automate
the entire process.
